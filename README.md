# Gravitational Potential Xplorer (GPX)

**GPX** is a Python-based tool for simulating and visualizing 3D gravitational potentials generated by multiple bodies.

---

## Features

- Compute gravitational potential on 3D grids  
- Supports both manual input and CSV-based data loading  
- Visualize results using Matplotlib  
- User-driven inputs for flexibility  
- Modular code with clear structure

---

## Included files

- `GPX.ipynb`: Interactive notebook version for step-by-step execution  
- `GPX.py`: Clean Python script version for direct use

---

## Demo CSV Files

This repository includes two CSV files used for different parts of the simulation:

- `GPX_SourceMasses.csv`: Contains the positions and masses of the bodies generating the gravitational potential.
  
- `GPX_EvaluationGrid.csv`: Defines the 3D grid points where the gravitational potential is calculated.  

Both files serve as input data for the simulations. Their specific purposes correspond to the information conveyed by their filenames, and the code structure reflects how each file is utilized.

---

## Installation

No special installation required. Just clone the repo and run the notebooks/scripts in your Python environment.

---

## Usage

- Open `GPX.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
- Run cells step-by-step.  
- Modify inputs as needed.  
- Alternatively, run `GPX.py` as a script in your local Python setup.
