# Gravitational Potential Xplorer (GPX)

**GPX** is a Python-based tool for simulating and visualizing 3D gravitational potentials generated by multiple bodies.

---

## Features

- Compute gravitational potential on 3D grids  
- Supports both manual input and table-based data loading (`.csv` / `.fits`)  
- Visualize results using Matplotlib  
- User-driven inputs for flexibility  
- Modular code with clear structure  
- Save data tables as `.csv` or `.fits` files, and plots as `.png` or `.pdf` files

---

## Included files

- `GPX.ipynb`: Interactive notebook version for step-by-step execution  
- `GPX.py`: Clean Python script version for direct use

---

## Demo Data Files

This repository includes two example data files (available in **both `.csv` and `.fits` formats**) used for different parts of the simulation:

- `GPX_SourceMasses.csv` / `GPX_SourceMasses.fits`: Contains the positions and masses of the bodies generating the gravitational potential.  
- `GPX_EvaluationGrid.csv` / `GPX_EvaluationGrid.fits`: Defines the 3D grid points where the gravitational potential is calculated.  

Both files serve as input data for the simulations. Their specific purposes correspond to the information conveyed by their filenames, and the code structure reflects how each file is utilized.

> **Note:** `.fits` files are binary and cannot be previewed on GitHub. Download and open with `Astropy`, `fv` (FITS viewer), or other astronomy tools.

## Installation

No special installation required. Just clone the repo and run the notebooks/scripts in your Python environment.

---

## Usage

- Open `GPX.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
- Run cells step-by-step.  
- Modify inputs as needed.  
- Alternatively, run `GPX.py` as a script in your local Python setup.  
- When prompted for data files, you may use either `.csv` or `.fits` table formats.

---

## Status

The current version reflects a completed code structure with support for both `.csv` and `.fits` table formats, awaiting formal validation.
